# Changelog

## 0.3.0 - 2026-08-27

- Ship the npm channel: the package is `@passioncode-ai/fabric-agent-adapter`,
  an installer CLI (`bin/fabric-agent-adapter.js`) plus the plugin tree, with
  `install.sh` as the POSIX fallback.
- Add toggleable release automation (`release.yml`): a `v*` tag runs validate,
  checks tag reachability and version sync, cuts the GitHub release from the
  CHANGELOG section, smoke-tests the packed tarball from a clean cwd (the
  repository is private, so the tarball — not `npx github:` — is the artifact
  under test), and publishes to npm with provenance. Armed by RELEASE_ENABLED
  and PUBLISH_NPMJS repository variables.
- Extend the validator: package.json joins the version sync, the files
  whitelist and scoped-access rules are checked, and the new files are required.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-08-27

- Add the `creating-fabric-agents` skill: the intake grill (capability, named
  consumer, workflow-or-agent, profile, effect and tenancy declarations), the
  knowledge intake whose recorded traps become planted eval fixtures, skeleton
  and scaffold reuse of the pinned contract machinery, two-clock evals, and the
  canary-binding expectation in the conformance report.
- Point the adapting skill's boundary at its new sibling for greenfield requests.
- Rework the repository validator for multiple skills with per-skill trigger and
  scenario evals.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-08-27

- Add the `adapting-projects-to-fabric` skill.
- Add evidence-based MCP, A2A, and local-runner profile selection.
- Add a standard-library project inspector, non-destructive scaffolder, and checker.
- Add contract pinning and independent conformance gate reporting.
- Add trigger/scenario evals, unit tests, repository validator, and plugin packaging.
